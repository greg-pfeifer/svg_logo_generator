## Description

This project was completed for the purpose of creating an SVG logo generator. Using the command line and Node JS, a user can respond to prompts and choose the appearance of an svg logo by shape, shape color, text and text color inputs. The application then generates an SVG file with the selected logo as based on the user's selections.   

## Usage

Type the following command in the terminal to start the application

        node index.js

Then answer the prompts with the desired text, text color, and shape color choices.

To test that all three shapes are generating correctly (with Jest), run the following command in the terminal

        npm test
