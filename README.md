## Description

This project was completed for the purpose of creating an SVG logo generator. Using the command line and Node JS, a user can respond to prompts and choose the appearance of an svg logo by shape, shape color, text and text color inputs. The application then generates an SVG file with the selected logo as based on the user's selections.   

## Usage

As seen in the demnostration video, the user types "node index.js" to initialize the application and then follows the prompts to fill in the information for each part of the logo design. Since this is a command-line application, Github deployment is not applicable to the application.
